# Dataverse 4.7

Resources to deploy Dataverse in Kubernetes or [NDS Labs](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs).

This is a preliminary implementation of the [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org/) with  [TwoRavens](http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/about-tworavens) and [iRODS](http://irods.org/) integration for use with the NDS Labs system. The Dataverse/iRODS integration is based on work by the Odum Institute and RENCI.

## Dockerfiles
A set of images used to deploy Dataverse, TwoRavens, and iRODS in [NDS Labs](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs).

These images are referenced by the [NDS Labs Service Catalog](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-specs).

## Kubernetes
A set of configuration files used to deploy Dataverse in a Kubernetes cluster.

While these configuration files are no longer used by this project, they have been kept for historical purposes.
